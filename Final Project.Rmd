## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(keras)
library(tfdatasets)


#Loading a csv file
WindQualityDataFrame <- read.csv("WineQT.csv")

# Various syntax for R dataframes
summary(irisdf)

head(irisdf)

# You can refer to columns by name or by number:
head(irisdf[1]) # head takes the first few elements

head(irisdf$sepal.length)

head(irisdf["sepal.length"])
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
