# Wine Data Machine Learning Models

These data were obtained from the University of California Irvine's (UCI) [Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine). These data are the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. These models attempt to determine the `quality` of both white and red wines, and predict the `Type` of wine (White or Red).
